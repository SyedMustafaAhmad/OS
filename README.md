# Operating_System

Greetings,

Introduction:
I am Syed Mustafa Ahmed and this was my Final Project in second semester of my Bachelors in Computer Science. The project required me to build a program (no gui) with c++ and concepts of object oriented programming.
As an experiment I tried to program an operating system without prior reference so that I could see and recreate the thought process of it being open to interpretation. I surprisingly got a few things right to what we have in real life Operating Systems.
Since I had to finish this project in two weeks alongside another project approaching finals so it is a broken mess but in a good way. I learnt a lot and can see how to improve myself in the future. It's a long way to go.

P.S : Please criticize and improve this project if you plan to do it yourself. I'd also like to know about your progress.

Regards,
Syed Mustafa Ahmed
